# Mhack challenge for Jan 7, 2021 by Daniel

Make any original piece of art/animation with [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas). It doesn't have to be complicated, just getting familiar with a new browser API is the whole point.

This repo just offers a starting point so you can all skip the boilerplate setup.  It provides a very simple live-reload server.  No other complexity is included.  No build, just edit a single JS file.

## Quick-start

```
npm install
npm start
```

 1. Open [http://localhost:8345](http://localhost:8345/)
 2. Edit `src/canvas.js` (and `src/index.html` if you need to)
